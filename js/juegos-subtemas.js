        <h3>Minecraft</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Minecraft</strong> as a concept is complicated. Defining it is to fall into an endless stream of categories and ideas. In this section, it will be somewhat reflective and based on my own experience.
            <br><br>
            Arriving one day at noon and trying for the first time in my life the Playstation 3 demo was a total paradigm shift compared to any game I had played until then. At about 8 years old, the concept, the music, and the aesthetics of the game itself conveyed too many emotions and sensations that no other game had managed to awaken before.
            <br><br>
            I probably played version 1.3 or 1.4 of the game, very early versions with the visuals of a game that had not yet been destroyed by Microsoft, but rather still belonged to the original creator.
            <br><br>
            From feeling completely alone in a world with no end, totally unaware of the game's full capabilities, the impossibility of performing actions, and the invitation for the player to experiment however possible.
            <br><br>
            How is it possible that I could dedicate so many hours non-stop to a game demo?
            <br>

            <br>
            After this pleasant experience, I began to delve deeper into the game, even falling into the many Android copies, flash games, and everything similar, until finally in 2014 I started playing it properly.
            <br><br>
            This game holds a very important place in my life, as without a doubt, even without specific numbers, it is the game to which I have dedicated the most hours by far, at least around 800 to 1200 hours in total.
            <br>

            <br>
            To this day, although I no longer dedicate as much time to it as before, I still consider it one of the best experiences in any game. It stands apart from any current game, even marking a before and after in how I appreciate leisure time.

        <h3>Undertale</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Undertale</strong> is a unique narrative experience, where every decision matters and the characters seem to have a life of their own.
            <br><br>
            What I admire most is how it manages to convey deep emotions with simple resources, and how it plays with the player's expectations.
            <br><br>
            The music, the humor, and the moments of reflection make Undertale an unforgettable game.
            <img src="img/sources/floweydialogue.gif" alt="Undertale" style="max-width:100%;margin-top:1em;">
            <br><br>
            From the very first moment the game starts, the surprises begin. I won't go on too long, but without a doubt, having dedicated so many hours to this game has been one of the best decisions I've made.
            <br><br>
            I would like to make a special mention of the entire musical section it offers, and it's especially interesting that all the music was composed by the game's creator even before starting the game's development.<br>
            That's why the game is adjusted to the music and not the other way around.<br>
            <img src="img/sources/sansdialogue.jpg" alt="Sans dialogue" style="max-width:100%;margin-top:1em;">
            <br><br>
            Here are some of what I consider the best tracks in the game:<br>
           <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HIKNbnV8nw" target="_blank">Undertale - Main Theme</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVUh7caufKU" target="_blank">Waterfall/a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtC-pl9P3kE" target="_blank">It's Raining Somewhere Else</a></li>
            </ul>
            <img src="img/sources/sigues-siendo-tu.jpg" alt="Sans dialogue" style="max-width:100%;margin-top:1em;">
            <br><br>
            It's amazing how at the end of the game you realize you're still the same person deep down.
            <br><br>
            The three endings are masterful and all connect with each other. And if you're one of those people who thinks the experience is only enjoyable with the pacifist route, I can only say that <b> you should burn in hell </b>.

        <h3>Blasphemous</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Blasphemous</strong> is an experience that goes far beyond difficulty and challenge. It is a journey through a world that seems made of pain, faith, and redemption, where every step you take is marked by the weight of penance and guilt.
            <br><br>
            I remember the first time I entered Cvstodia. The atmosphere was so dense it seemed the air itself was heavy. The art, inspired by Spanish folklore and religious imagery, manages to convey a sense of unease and beauty in equal measure. Every setting is loaded with symbolism, every enemy seems a manifestation of some sin or suffering.
            <br><br>
            What struck me most was the way the game forces you to face your own limits. There are no concessions: every mistake is paid for, every victory feels like a small redemption. The music perfectly accompanies that atmosphere, with melodies that sound like prayers and laments, reinforcing the feeling of being in a sacred and cursed place at the same time.
            <br><br>
            <img src="img/sources/angel-blasphemous.jpg" alt="Blasphemous art" style="max-width:100%; margin-top:1em; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">
            <br>
            The protagonist, the Penitent, is almost a reflection of the player: someone who moves forward by sheer will, bearing the weight of their own guilt and seeking some kind of meaning amid suffering. There are no long dialogues or direct explanations, but every object, every statue, and every corner tells a story that feels both personal and universal.
            <br><br>
            Blasphemous is not just a difficult game; it is a work that invites you to reflect on faith, guilt, and redemption. It is a reminder that sometimes, the darkest path can lead you to discover something valuable about yourself.
            <br>
            <img src="img/sources/boss-blasphemous.jpg" alt="Blasphemous boss" style="max-width:100%; margin-top:1em; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">
            <br>
            If you've ever been drawn to worlds that mix the sacred and the profane, to stories that are not afraid to show pain and beauty in the same scene, Blasphemous is an experience worth living. Not just for its challenging gameplay, but for the way it manages to leave a mark on those who dare to walk its paths.
