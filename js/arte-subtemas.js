        <h3>Painting</h3>
        <p>
            Painting is one of the oldest and most universal forms of artistic expression. From prehistoric caves to contemporary art, painting has been a medium to capture emotions, ideas, and visions of the world.
            <br><br>
            Here I share some works, styles, and curiosities about painting that I find fascinating.

            <strong>La Miseria (1886), oil on canvas.</strong> <br><br>
            Cristobal Rojas (1857-1890), Cua - Venezuela. Rojas suffered from tuberculosis while painting this work. He wanted to describe the social aspects of the disease and its relationship with living conditions at the end of the 19th century.

            <strong>Tomb of a Suicide | Wilhelm Kotarbiński | 1900</strong> <br><br> 
            This painting depicts a somber and haunting night scene, with a solitary white flower blooming through a derelict tomb stone, illuminated by a dim light from above. A dark, dense atmosphere envelops the scene, under a night sky. The flower appears to be bleeding, symbolizing the act of suicide. The surrounding landscape is barren and desolate, with dried plants and lifeless terrain, enhancing the sense of isolation and tragedy. The artwork captures a poignant moment of beauty and sorrow intertwined.

            <br><br>
            <strong>The Entombment of Atala, 1808</strong> <br><br> 
            The painting captures the moment when Father Aubry and Chactas prepare to bury Atala, a young Christian woman who chose to end her life rather than break her vow of chastity.
            <br><br>
            Girodet’s composition blends Neoclassical precision with Romantic sentiment, emphasizing the emotional intensity of the scene.
            <br><br>
            Atala, dressed in a white burial shroud, holds a crucifix, symbolizing her devotion to faith.

            <strong>The Death of Marat | Jacques-Louis David | 1748-1825</strong> <br><br>
            <br>
            <img src="img/sources/marat-description.jpg" alt="cave" style="max-width:80%; margin-top:1em; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">
            <br><br>
            The French Revolution is underway and Jacques-Louis David is in charge of giving it some propaganda through the new fashionable style: neoclassicism.
            <br><br>
            That same year Jean-Paul Marat died, one of the architects of the Reign of Terror, stabbed by Charlotte Corday who wanted to "save France".
            <br><br>
            Marat relaxed in a bathtub (very much like Jim Morrison), as he suffered from violent itching due to a skin disease (now known to be celiac disease). Meanwhile, he wrote a blacklist of state enemies to be guillotined. Corday showed up with the excuse of denouncing some names and suddenly pulled a knife hidden in her dress, killing Marat.
            <br><br>
            As we know, at that time David was a close friend of Marat and admired him greatly for his natural gift for convincing the masses with his speeches, something David wanted to do through painting. That’s why he wanted to honor him as one of the first martyrs of the revolution.
            <br><br>
            When the Reign of Terror fell (with Robespierre guillotined), David fell too, along with this painting. In fact, Charlotte Corday was considered a French heroine.
            <br><br>
            It would take the arrival of the young and talented general named Napoleon Bonaparte for his figure to be considered again.

        <h3>Liminal Spaces</h3>
        <p>
            There are places that are not places, but thresholds. The endless hallway, the light that is neither day nor night, the echo of footsteps that belong to no one. In these spaces, reality dissolves and one becomes a shadow, a question, a waiting.
            <br><br>
            <img src="img/sources/dont-go.jpg" alt="cave" style="max-width:80%; margin-top:1em; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">
            <br><br>
            Who hasn't felt the strangeness of an empty room, the tremor of a deserted park, the promise of a half-open door? Liminal spaces are the territory of the possible, where time stops and memory blends with desire.
            <br><br>
            <img src="img/sources/lonely-room.jpg" alt="cave" style="max-width:80%; margin-top:1em; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">
            <br><br>
            Here, nostalgia is not memory, but omen. Silence weighs like a certainty and artificial light draws invisible borders between what we are and what we could be. Camus would say it is the instant when life reveals itself as absurd and yet beautiful. Cortázar would look for the cronopio hiding behind the curtain, Pizarnik would write verses about the solitude inhabiting the corners, Nietzsche would ask if it is not on the threshold where man meets himself.
            <br><br>
            <img src="img/sources/pc-room.jpg" alt="cave" style="max-width:80%; margin-top:1em; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">
            <br><br>
            Liminal spaces are not explained, they are crossed. They are the interlude, the breath, the crack through which the possibility of another world seeps in. And in that transit, one learns that beauty is not always in the destination, but in the uncertain path that precedes it.

            Photography captures unrepeatable moments and allows us to see the world from new perspectives. From portraits to urban landscapes, photography is both document and art.
